 *
 * This a divide and conquer Algorithm.
 * Recursive Algorithm
 * It has two phases: Splitting and Merging
 * Splitting phases leads to faster sorting during merging.
 * Splitting is done logically
 * performance is 0(nlogn) to base 2 because we are dividing by two
 * Merge sort is a stable algorithm
